"""
    QWSearch(model, parameters, marked, penalty[; check])

Simulates quantum search on `model` with `marked` vertices and additional `parameters`.
`penalty` represents the cost of initial state creation and measurement, which should
be included for better optimization, see documentation of `maximizing_function`.
Note that marked vertices needs to be between `1` and `nv(graph(model))`. Furthermore
penalty needs to be nonnegative.

`check_qwdynamics` is executed if and only iff `check` is true.

Needs implementation of
* `initial_state(qws::QWSearch)`
* `evolve(qws::QWSearch{<:QWModelDiscr}, state)` or `evolve(qws::QWSearch{<:QWModelCont}, state, time::Real)`
* `measure(qws::QWSearch, state[, vertices])`
* `check_qwdynamics(QWSearch, model::QWModel, parameters::Dict{Symbol}, penalty::Real)`
* proper constructors.

Offers functions
* `execute`
* `execute_single`
* `execute_single_measured`
* `execute_all`
* `execute_all_measured`
* `maximize_quantum_search`.

It is encoureged to implement constructor, which changes the `penalty` and/or `marked`
vertices only, as their are usually simple to adapt.
